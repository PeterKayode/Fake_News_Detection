# Machine Learning Basic Projects Repository 🤖

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository! Here, you'll find a collection of three projects that I have developed in the field of machine learning. Each project aims to solve a specific problem using various machine learning techniques.

## Projects 🚀

### 1. Fake News Detection 📰

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It analyzes the textual content of news articles to identify patterns and features indicative of fake news.

### 2. Loan Approval System 💰

The Loan Approval System project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected. It considers various factors such as applicant's credit history, income, and loan amount to make accurate predictions.

### 3. Movies Recommendation System 🎬

The Movies Recommendation System project employs collaborative filtering and recommendation algorithms to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and past interactions. It enhances user experience by providing personalized movie recommendations.
